# Server Test Coverage Checklist

This checklist tracks practical behavioral coverage for implemented server workflows using the xUnit suite in `tests/Server.Tests`.

| Workflow area | Status | Test files |
|---|---|---|
| Config validation | Covered | `ConfigTests.fs` |
| Bootstrap folders | Covered | `ConfigTests.fs` |
| Generate planning | Covered | `GenerateTests.fs` |
| Generate collision checks | Covered | `GenerateTests.fs` |
| Generate filesystem operation | Covered | `GenerateTests.fs` |
| Run manifest and script planning | Covered | `RunTests.fs` |
| Run submission guards | Covered | `RunTests.fs` |
| Collect preflight | Covered | `CollectTests.fs` |
| Collect preflight log footer classification | Covered | `CollectTests.fs` |
| Collect preflight CSV numeric-row validation | Covered | `CollectTests.fs` |
| Collect exclusion behavior | Covered | `CollectTests.fs` |
| Collect CSV merge | Covered | `CollectTests.fs` |
| Collect statistics | Covered | `CollectTests.fs` |
| Collect operation | Covered | `CollectTests.fs` |

Notes:

- This is workflow-level behavioral coverage, not line/branch coverage.
- Tests use temporary folders and fake CSV/process output fixtures.
- Real Slurm execution and real TOPAS execution remain manual smoke-test responsibilities.
